      <p>hey. i'm Saaim</p>
      <p>
        i recently moved to san francisco from the uk with $1500. probably not
        the smartest decision. to be honest, my whole life i’ve just followed my
        curiosity
      </p>
      <p>at 9, i started kung fu, specifically wing chun</p>
      <p>
        at 10, i started a blog called ‘things you should know’, sharing
        interesting things i was learning
      </p>
      <p>
        at 11, i bashed games and became pretty good. although relative to some
        of my friends who became #1 globally, i wasn’t that gooood
      </p>
      <p>at 12, i coded my first project - a basic website in html and css</p>
      <p>
        at 13, i started cold emailing random internet people and i got replies
        from some heroes
      </p>
      <p>at 14, i started playing the piano</p>
      <p>
        at 15, i did some home servicing and sold stuff at school. eventually a
        much older ‘competitor’ ratted me out and personally made it very clear
        that i should stop
      </p>
      <p>at 16, i edited videos for a youtuber with 250k subs</p>
      <p>
        at 17, i started cooking and baking ... if you’re in san francisco, lmk,
        i’ll make you some food ... if i have time
      </p>
      <p>
        {`at 18, i joined unilever as a data analyst in a <1% acceptance, fully paid degree apprenticeship - then i left 2 years later - corporate life wasn’t for me or maybe i wasn’t for corporate life`}
      </p>
      <p>
        at 20, i became employee #1 at univeristy.co.uk - then i left after 1
        month because i didn’t agree with the founders’ vision
      </p>
      <p>
        soon after, i joined an early stage b2b startup called shape - this was
        amazing - the ceo gave me tons of freedom and agency - i worked on
        hiring, sales, partnerships, and more
      </p>
      <p>
        9 months later, i moved to san francisco and started spidey with a
        friend from los angeles. we were turning learning into a game, bringing
        the worlds best gaming mechanics to education. we gave up far too
        quickly and this still haunts me. btw, shoutout jaivin - one of the most
        cracked, tasteful, and kindest people i know
      </p>
      <p>
        after sf, i went back to the uk. i joined a legal tech startup and very
        quickly got fired for the first time ever, because i had a disagreement
        with my manager. that was a rough time and ultimately i came to the
        conclusion that i’m unemployable
      </p>
      <p>
        now i’m building again ... properly this time. i’ve started a new
        company called magic and our goal is to build products that inspire
        creativity and agency in the age of ai. to start we've built an ai toy
        that encourages limitless and open ended play. our goal is to build the
        most fun toy that children will ever play with - a toy i wished i had as
        a child. we named the toy lumo - check him out and consider buying one
        ... i’m kinda broke lol
